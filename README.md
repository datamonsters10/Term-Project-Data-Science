# Term-Project-Data-Science
The best term project there will ever be.

## Motivation for this project

When we started this project we were curious about how fair were the votations for the Baseball Hall of Fame. With this concept in mind we started gathering data and adjusting it for further analysis. We then perform multiple types of analysis such as: hypothesis testing, prediction (regression) analysis, classification,  time-series analysis, clustering, and finally verified them. We will present the conslusion that we found in this file.


## Prerequisites

### Built With

* [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) - The software used.
* [R Language](https://cran.r-project.org/) - Programming language used.

### Libraries Required
This project was made in the R language, utilizing RStudio.
The Libraries that are require for this R project to properly run are:

```
library(tidyverse)
library(forecast)
library(knitr)
library(party)
library(caTools)
library(Metrics)
```

### Gathering the data

The data for this project was gathered from the webpage [Baseball refence](https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_2018.shtml).

Our team collected data about the hall of fame from different years starting in 1989 through 2019. All the different years were then summarized into one data frame.

### Anlysis on the data

The data was divided in different sub divisions throughout the project in order to performhypothesis testing, prediction (regression) analysis, classification,  time-series analysis, clustering, and finally verified them. These divisions are explained in the project itself, so a clear understanding can be achieved.
